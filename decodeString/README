https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/


Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].

**Solution**

Using a stack, we'll push until we encounter a "]" then we will start popping.  We stop popping untill the number before "[" is read.  Becareful to not just take into one digit since the number can be several digits long.

simple string concatenation in between.
