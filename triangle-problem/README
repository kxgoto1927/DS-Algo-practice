Triangle Problem (https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle/)

Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

For example, given the following triangle

[
     [2],
    [3,4],
   [6,5,7],
  [4,1,8,3]
]

The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).

**SOLUTION**

My approach is to start from the bottom.  The parent element can only be a result of two operations so we compute them both and then set the parent element to the result of the lesser sum.

I.e. (6+4) > (6+1), so arr[i-1][j] == 7

In the end the first element of the triangle will contain the result of the minimum path.
