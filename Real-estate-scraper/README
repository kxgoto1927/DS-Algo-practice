A real estate client who invests in tax liens approached me with a web scraping project.

This project was to scrape the contents of http://www.cookcountyassessor.com given a unique PIN (Property Identification Number)

The requirements:

1.  Must contain the contents of the entire page.
2.  File name much be the PIN in format XX-XX-XXX-XXXX.PDF
3.  Footer must contain link to the page and the date.


Price: $1500


Explanation of code (See DataSync.py):

pdfkit is needed to create a PDF from a url
time is needed to capture the time to ultimately output to the footer of each PDF
pyPdf is needed to read and write PDFs
canvas is needed to draw the footer onto a pdf
letter is needed for the pagesize

The file begins by reading a list of PID from a file called input.txt.

Then, it will loop through to create a URL for the property at cookcountyaccessor site.

Next, it will load the page into a PDF, the footer with url & date onto another, then merge them into one PDF.

Rinse and repeat for n, n being the number of PID's
